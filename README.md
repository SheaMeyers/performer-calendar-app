# Performer Calendar App / Seat Geek Calendar

This original idea of this project was initially meant to gather data from many different sources and thus the more generic name of Performer Calendar App.

However it currently only gathers data from SeatGeek and therefore has the more accurate name of Seat Geek Calendar.
